This is the folder for my Machine Learning Final Project.
Spring Semester 2016.

The goal of the project was:
To predict the outcomes of tennis matches by using neural networks.
The vast majority of work was done in Rstudio.

Below is a description of each file/folder in this folder:

originalpaper.pdf: This is the original paper which gave me the idea to pursue this project.

Presentation: This is the powerpoint used for the presentation in class.

network pictures: These are graph network pictures from tennis matches in 2015 that were produced using Gephi, the application I used during my presentation. An accompanying README file in the folder explains the pictures in-depth.

ExampleData.csv: This is an example of the raw data I used for the project. This is the 2015 match data, match data was collected dating back to 1996.

CalculatingStats.docx: This document explains the calculations needed for my final model. It also discusses some of the assumptions I needed to make as the data came with little explanation.

MLFFinalpaper.Rmd: This is the Rmd file for the final paper.

MLFFinalpaper.pdf: This is the pdf for my final paper.

MLfinalprojectWork.Rmd: This is the Rmd file that contains all my work for this project.

MLfinalprojectWork.html: html rendering of the Rmd file. Does not calculate every neural net, but each modelâ€™s code is run. Most of the models run are simple with a hidden layer of 5 or 10 nodes. Simple modification of the code can be made to attain all results presented in paper. This html file also includes preliminary analysis with plots as well.

2015 tennis matches(ipynb).html: This is the ipython notebook I used in html form(as opening ipython notebooks is difficult if you dont have the software installed). It contains the analysis of the final model with respect to betting lines.
